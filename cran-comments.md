## Additional information for CRAN

This package, similarly to our other tools (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AmpGram), this package uses an external GitHub package with a model (https://github.com/BioGenies/CancerGramModel). We are not using the Additional_repositories field as there is no CRAN style repository in that location and hence the declaration won't have any effect anyway (thanks to Uwe Ligges for clarification).

We do not provide any DOIs as the publication with the CancerGram is still in review.
